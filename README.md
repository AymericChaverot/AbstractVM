# AbstractVM

AbstractVM is a simplified pseudo ASM interpreter

It is an EPITECH project written in **C++**

Some imperative technical parts were :
- Implement an IOperand interface
- Implement a Factory object with a static member function to create operands
- The VM must have a stack and 16 registers
- The program must not use any external library
- The program must use `STL`
- The program must not use any `libc` functions except for those that encapsulate syscalls that have no equivalent in C++
